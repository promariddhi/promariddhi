# Hi, I’m Proma 👋

I’m a backend- and systems-oriented developer interested in how software works **beneath abstractions**.  
I like building small but real tools to understand scheduling, state, algorithms, and system behavior.

Most of my projects are learning-driven: I try to build things from scratch, reason about trade-offs, and keep the scope intentionally minimal.

---

## 🧠 Current Focus
- Backend & systems fundamentals (state, time, scheduling, data flow)
- Building developer tools and algorithm visualisations
- Learning by implementing concepts end-to-end rather than relying on frameworks

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python (primary), JavaScript  
- **Backend:** Python standard library, basic networking & concurrency concepts  
- **Frontend (when needed):** React, Tailwind CSS  
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, SQLite  
- **Other:** Linux basics, CLI tooling, Unity (simulation/visualisation)

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🎥 `roundtable` - Video Conferencing App (Full Stack)
A minimal end-to-end video conferencing application built to understand real-time communication systems.

- Authenticated users can create meetings and join via links
- WebRTC for peer-to-peer audio/video
- Socket.IO–based signaling
- Clean handling of peer lifecycle (join, leave, cleanup)
- Smooth and Modern UI
  
**Concepts:** JWT, WebRTC, socket.io, signaling, real-time systems

### 🕒 `jobmngr` — In-memory Job Scheduler (Python)
A simple job scheduler that manages timed task execution using core Python constructs.  
Focuses on scheduling logic, time management, and internal state rather than external frameworks.

**Concepts:** scheduling, priority queues, concurrency, daemons and ipc

---

### ⏱ `projtimer` — CLI Project Time Tracker (Python)
A command-line tool to track total time spent on projects.  
Built to explore CLI ergonomics, persistence, and minimal user-facing tooling.

**Concepts:** CLI design, state persistence, developer tooling

---

### 🛰 `coverage-visualiser-web` - Exploring real life algorithms
A web-based visualiser for drone area-coverage algorithms, hosted on Vercel.  
Built to understand and compare algorithmic behavior visually rather than just numerically.

**Concepts:** greedy algorithms, visualisation, algorithm intuition

---

## 📌 Notes
- Some projects are intentionally incomplete or experimental — they exist to support learning.
- I prefer depth over polish and fundamentals over abstractions.
- I’m gradually refining and consolidating projects as my understanding improves.
